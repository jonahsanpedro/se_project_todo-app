# Simple Todo App

The main purpose of this project is to gain comprehension on refactoring existing JavaScript in Object-Oriented Programming.

## Functionality

This project focused mainly on refactoring our project using OOP.

## Technology

This sprint intorduced a new concept called object-oriented programming. Primarily focusing on objects that make up a program and how one object stores data and can be passed from one object to another. This is made possible through key OOP concepts like encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism. We also covered how data and functions are used under OOP and how they are different than how we covered functions in past sprints.
